## Chart Explanation

```
For each Hotel, I calculated the total sum of consumption for each electricity supply meter,
this gives us an insight about each hotel which electricity supply they consume the most.

## Issue with step 3


```
Unfortunately for some reasons the hyperlink isn't working :( 
However, you can Navigate directly to an example here [http://127.0.0.1:8000/explore/9539](http://127.0.0.1:8000/explore/9539) 
the graph will render normally. meanwhile will keep working on this bug.
```

> I disabled the hyperlink in my `explore.html` temporarily until I figure it out.
